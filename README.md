# Armnn Backend Framework

The framework is a demo for developing a new backend device used in ArmNN.

The original source code is downloaded from ARM official website（[click here to download](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Arm%20Developer%20Community/Images/Tutorial%20Guide%20Diagrams%20and%20Screenshots/Machine%20Learning/Build%20Arm%20NN%20custom%20backend%20plugins/ArmNNPluginFramework.zip?revision=b5f17291-7319-4b63-b08c-81b1be3da736&la=en&hash=29216C1B54DE7B0304E248D19647C7960EB26FB6 "Download here")）

However, the original source code is not compatible with the latest armnn branch（21_05）.

So just create the repo for reference as some compile error fix.

You can clone it and place it to the armn/src/backends/ for your project without compile error.
